# Lost-Loved-
  I'm 57 1/2 yrs young &amp; I was diagnosed with early stage 2 COPD on 7/28/23,  Left: 55%- Right 50%, on 7/31/2024, I have late stage 2 , Left: 50%- Right: 45%, I was given 5 to 7 years! I thought I had a second chance, all my Love wasted on a narcissistic apprentice he's been around a narcissist  for yrs! I have become his KARMA!
